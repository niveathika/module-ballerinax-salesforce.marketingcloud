## Overview

[Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/) is a leading digital marketing platform that enables businesses to manage and automate customer journeys, email campaigns, and personalized messaging.

The `ballerinax/salesforce.marketingcloud` package provides APIs to connect and interact with [Salesforce Marketing Cloud API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mc-apis.meta/mc-apis/) endpoints, supporting a wide range of marketing automation and journey management

### Step 2: Create an installed package

1. In the **Setup** menu, scroll down to the **Platform Tools** section.
2. Click on **Apps** and then select **Installed Packages**.

3. Click the **New** button.
4. Enter a **Name** and **Description** for your package (for example, `API Integration Package`).
5. Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Add an API integration component

1. After saving, click on the package you just created to view its details.

2. Click on **Add Component**.
3. Choose **API Integration** as the component type.

4. Select Server-to-Server as the integration type.

   <img src="docs/setup/resources/7-sfmc-integration-type.png" title="SFMC new integration type" width="50%" alt="SFMC installed package integration type"/>

5. In the list of available scopes, check the required permissions for your integration. For most token generation and API calls, you might need:
   * Read and Write access to Email Studio
   * Access to the REST API
   * Any additional scopes based on your specific use case

     <img src="docs/setup/resources/8-sfmc-scope.png" title="SFMC component scope" width="75%" alt="SFMC component scopes"/>

6. Click **Save** to add the component.

### Step 4: Retrieve the Client ID and Client Secret

On the package detail page, note down the Base URIs, Client ID and Client Secret generated for your integration. These credentials are required to authenticate API calls.
If necessary, click on Edit to update any integration details or to add further scopes.

<img src="docs/setup/resources/10-sfmc-client.png" title="SFMC client id" width="95%" alt="SFMC client id"/>

### Step 5: Retrieve your user subdomain

Extract the subdomain by taking the portion between `https://` and `.auth.marketingcloudapis.com` in your base URI. For example, from `https://mc123456gkz1x4p5b9m4gzx5b9.auth.marketingcloudapis.com/`, the subdomain is `mc123456gkz1x4p5b9m4gzx5b9`.

## Quickstart

To use the `salesforce.marketingcloud` connector in your Ballerina application, modify the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `salesforce.marketingcloud` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/salesforce.marketingcloud;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

Create a `marketingcloud:ConnectionConfig` with the obtained OAuth2.0 tokens and initialize the connector with it.

```ballerina
configurable string clientId = ?;
configurable string clientSecret = ?;
configurable string subDomain = ?;

marketingcloud:Client marketingCloudClient = check new (
    config = {
        auth: {
            clientId,
            clientSecret
        }
    },
    subDomain = subDomain
);
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### Get unread emails in INBOX

```ballerina
marketingcloud:ContactMembershipResponse res = 
        check marketingCloudClient->getContactMembership({
            contactKeyList: ["test@example.com"]
        });
```

## Examples

The `ballerinax/salesforce.marketingcloud` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios. Explore these [examples](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-salesforce.marketingcloud/tree/main/examples) to understand how to capture and process database change events effectively.

1. [Welcome Journey](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-salesforce.marketingcloud/tree/main/examples/welcome-journey) - Demonstrates how to enroll new users into the Welcome Journey. It includes additional checks to ensure that users are not enrolled more than once, preventing duplicate enrollments in the journey.
