# Examples

The `ballerinax/salesforce.marketingcloud` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios. Explore these [examples](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-salesforce.marketingcloud/tree/main/examples) to understand how to capture and process database change events effectively.

1. [Welcome Journey](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-salesforce.marketingcloud/tree/main/examples/welcome-journey) - Demonstrates how to enroll new users into the Welcome Journey. It includes additional checks to ensure that users are not enrolled more than once, preventing duplicate enrollments in the journey.

## Prerequisites

1. Follow instructions to set up OAuth2 app in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

2. For each example, create a config.toml file with your OAuth2 tokens, client ID, and client secret. Here's an example of how your config.toml file should look:
```toml
clientId = "<client-id>"
clientSecret = "<client-secret>"
subDomain = "<sub-domain>"
```


## Running an example

Execute the following commands to build an example from the source:

* To build an example:

    ```bash
    bal build
    ```

* To run an example:

    ```bash
    bal run
    ```

## Building the examples with the local module

**Warning**: Due to the absence of support for reading local repositories for single Ballerina files, the Bala of the module is manually written to the central repository as a workaround. Consequently, the bash script may modify your local Ballerina repositories.

Execute the following commands to build all the examples against the changes you have made to the module locally:

* To build all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh build
    ```

* To run all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh run
    ```
